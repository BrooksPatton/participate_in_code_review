Notes:
- You are not your code! Every developer needs feedback on their work, and that feedback isn't an attack on them or their ability. Enthusiastically embrace constructive criticism!
#### Write a paragraph reflecting on the feedback you received:
 - What was surprising? What did you learn about your coding style that you didn't know before/realize could be improved?
 - Was some of it expected? What bad habits do you know you have that you continue to embrace?
 - If you disagree with any of the feedback, why?
