# Example 1

Examine the code in sample.js and provide feedback and provide positive, thorough feedback.

- Do a quick overview of the sample code
- Go back and look for style issues
### -As you find errors, insert a comment in the code using "//" notation. If you find an error repeated, you can reference previous comments
- Go back through the code and look for syntax issues, leaving comments as you go
### -When you're finished reviewing, submit a pull request to the original repo  

Notes:
- You don't have to make the changes to the code! Just provide constructive feedback, the developer will incorporate your changes after review.

- The provided code samples are snippets and not necessarily complete- don't worry about things like missing "requires" or functions being called that aren't defined.

Feedback should be:
- Positive
- Focused
- Concise
- Measurable

Things to look for:

- No console logs in production code
- Consistent indentation
- Descriptive Variable/Function names
- Modular functions
- Only have necessary code in doc.ready
- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- Consistent Spacing
- Consistent Semi-colons
- No pyramid of dooooom
