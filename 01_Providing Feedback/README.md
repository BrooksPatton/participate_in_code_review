Notes:
- Feedback should be positive. Don't say "Your code is unreadable", say "Consistent indentation would make error catching easier"
- Feedback should be concise and focused. Don't say "I don't like your style", say "Your menu would be easier to find if you moved it from the footer to the header" 
- Feedback should be measurable. Don't say "Fix your functions", say "Your functions work, but some do too much. Look at each one and refactor so each function only does one thing."
