# Implementing feedback

In this role, you will focus on implementing the feedback you received.

To do this, create a branch called "feedback" and implement changes there. Link to the original branch and the "feedback" branch below.

Notes:
- Tackle feedback one point at a time. If you have indentation issues, fix all of those before you start refactoring functions.
- Be discerning. If you were encouraged to have more descriptive variable names, implement those on a case-by-case basis. That doesn't mean every variable has a bad name, "would some one else know what this variable stands for?" is just a lens for you to critique your code.  
- You don't necessarily have to implement every change. If you have considered it and disagree with the feedback, that's okay. That's also very different than thinking it would be too much work to implement/being defensive and not accepting good feedback.
#### Write a paragraph reflecting on the process:
 - What did you learn about your own code? Did you find other patterns you want to work on?
 - How did it feel to go back and work on improving your code? Did you find you agreed with the feedback, even if you might not have noticed it when you were writing it the first time?
 - If you chose not to implement some  feedback, why not?
