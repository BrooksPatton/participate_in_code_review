Passing requires all values

## Comments should address

* [ ] Unnecessary variables declared (set menu = data then uses data instead of menu)
* [ ] Calls unnecessary functions in doc.ready. addItem, subTotal, addTax, total aren't dependent on the DOM
* [ ] Remove console.logs

## Style

* [ ] Comments are positive/neutral in tone
* [ ] Comments clearly address a specific issue
* [ ] Comments should ask for something that can be measured
